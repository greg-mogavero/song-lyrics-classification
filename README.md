# Song Lyric Classification by Artist
### Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project
---

In this project, I attempt to classify song lyrics by artist using an LSTM network. I used the following software and libraries for this project:

* python 3.6.1
* numpy 1.12.1
* pandas 0.20.1
* matplotlib 2.0.2
* scikit-learn 0.18.1
* Keras 2.0.6 (with Theano backend)
* Theano 0.9.0
* jupyter 1.0.0

The dataset that I use is included in the repository, but can also be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mousehead/songlyrics).
