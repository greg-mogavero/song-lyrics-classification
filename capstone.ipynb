    "## Project Description\n",
    "---\n",
    "Machine learning is commonly used to perform [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) (NLP), a “field of computer science, artificial intelligence and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, and, in particular, concerned with programming computers to fruitfully process large natural language corpora.” One particular use case for NLP is analyzing song lyrics to classify them by artist. A successful machine learning algorithm would not only have to take into account the songwriter’s lexicon, but also pick up on the unique subtleties of the artist’s style in order to differentiate artists who write about similar topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efforts have already been made by the machine learning community to classify songs based on their lyrics by genre and artist. [Sadovsky and Chen](https://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/2006/fp/sadovsky-x1n9-1-224n_final_report.pdf) used Maxent and SVM classifiers to accomplish this task fairly successfully. Using no acoustic information whatsoever, they were able to achieve 70-80% artist classification accuracy. Because they used Bag of Words for feature selection, they remark that they might have been able to achieve higher accuracy if they did some sort of semantic analysis.\n",
    "For this project, I will be using a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mousehead/songlyrics) comprised of 57,650 song lyrics scraped from LyricsFreak by Sergey Kuznetsov.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given song lyrics (text only) as input and the corresponding artists as labels, I will attempt to build a supervised learner that can classify new songs by artist. Input will be truncated or padded during preprocessing so that each sample is a fixed size.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will attempt to solve the problem of classifying song lyrics by artist by training a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network. These models, when trained on text data, can “remember” information they have seen in the past. I hypothesize that the ability to learn this contextual information will help the learner distinguish songs by different artists who have similar lexicons, but different styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get meaningful results, I will choose the 10 artists from the dataset with the largest repertoire of songs. After preprocessing the input text data using Word2Vec, I will train and test a basic LSTM network, analyze its performance, and then try to improve results through hyperparameter tuning and architecture modification. Final results will be compared against a benchmark model based on the models Sadovsky and Chen used in their experiment."
